### Project Goals
Problem space: task management, motivation, competition, productivity struggles

The motivation for solving this problem is to increase productivity across a wide variety of tasks. Users could make any task input, from the mundane to long-term, and would be able to work towards those goals in a competitive environment. However, it wouldnâ€™t be so competitive to the point of stress and negative life quality. It can be difficult to finish tasks, whether the issue is starting the project or finishing it. This difficulty can create stress, and our solution would target task completion in order to decrease the stress, depression, and anxiety that stem from being unable to be productive.

### Process
Elise and Gianna met and generated key interview questions, observation targets, and goals. They both conducted interviews and did research on their own time. Elise summarized the results and gathered common themes from the research. From that, Gianna listed subsequent requirements. Elise and Gianna did brainstorming and sketching together and discussed their ideas from the research. Then, they came to some final design ideas. They both drew 2 potential scenarios based off of the research done.
